Overview of the Project

Project: SQL Internship on Joins Practice

Objective
The objective of Task-1 is to practice and demonstrate the ability to combine data from multiple related tables using SQL JOIN operations. This task aims to help you understand how different joins work and how they are used in real-world data analysis to retrieve meaningful information from relational databases.

Key Activities
-Create database and tables required for the task
-Define relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys
-Insert sample records into the tables
-Perform different types of SQL JOINs
  -INNER JOIN
  -LEFT JOIN
  -RIGHT JOIN
-FULL OUTER JOIN / simulated FULL JOIN (if using MySQL)
-Execute queries to combine and analyze data meaningfully

Technologies Used
-SQL (Structured Query Language) – for writing join queries
-Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) such as
  -MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server (any one based on your setup)
-Database Client / Query Tool
  -MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin / SQL Server Management Studio / Command Line
-IDE / Text Editor (optional)
  -VS Code / Notepad++ for writing scripts
-Screenshot / Documentation Tool (for submission)
  -Snipping Tool / Word / PDF creator

Key Insights
-Joins help combine data from multiple related tables, enabling meaningful analysis instead of looking at tables individually.
-INNER JOIN returns only matching records → useful when you need strictly related data.
-LEFT JOIN preserves all data from the left table → helps identify unmatched or missing relationships.
-RIGHT JOIN preserves all data from the right table → highlights records in the secondary table without matching entries.
-FULL OUTER JOIN (or simulated FULL JOIN in MySQL) shows complete data visibility, including matched and unmatched rows from both tables.
-Primary keys and foreign keys play a crucial role in establishing relationships and referential integrity.
-Understanding joins improves analytical thinking and helps in real-world database reporting, BI, and data analytics tasks.
-Joins are foundational for advanced SQL operations like subqueries, CTEs, and window functions later in the internship.
